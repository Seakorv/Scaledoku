# Scaledoku

This is a sudoku game without numbers. Every number is replaced with a note which belongs to a specific scale.
The game starts with only chromatic scale and background music. Player needs to figure out the scale of the song which
will unlock the sudoku. Sudoku works like a normal sudoku, but it doesn't allow illegal moves. Notes can be listened by pressing them and you can also listen the rows/columns/boxes from their playbuttons. The background music evolves as the sudoku's solution will progress.
