# Scaledoku

Scaledoku is a game made with Unity. The game works like a basic sudoku, but the numbers are replaced with a note from a chosen scale. Player has to quess the scale first by listening the background music to unlock the sudoku. The "numbers" are notes 1-9, from prime to ninth. The background music evolves as the sudoku will progress.

The game doesn't yet work on mobile. There is no .exe file in github yet, so to run the game you'll have to download the Unity project and compile it.
